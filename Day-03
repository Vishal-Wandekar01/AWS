## üß© EC2 Instance Types

### General Purpose
General Purpose instances are designed to deliver a balance of compute, memory, and network resources. They are suitable for a wide range of applications, including web servers,
small databases, development and test environments, and more. 
**Use Cases:** Web servers, small databases, dev/test environments.

### Compute Optimized
Compute Optimized instances provide a higher ratio of compute power to memory. They excel in workloads that require high-performance processing such as batch processing, 
scientific modeling, gaming servers, and high-performance web servers.
**Use Cases:** Batch processing, scientific modeling, gaming servers.

### Memory Optimized
Memory Optimized instances are designed to handle memory-intensive workloads. They are suitable for applications that require large amounts of memory, such as in-memory databases,
real-time big data analytics, and high-performance computing.  
**Use Cases:** In-memory DBs, big data analytics, high-performance computing.

### Storage Optimized
Storage Optimized instances are optimized for applications that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets. 
They are ideal for tasks like data warehousing, log processing, and distributed file systems. 
**Use Cases:** Data warehousing, log processing, file systems.

### Accelerated Computing
Accelerated Computing Instances typically come with one or more types of accelerators, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs),
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), or custom Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). 
These accelerators offload computationally intensive tasks from the main CPU, enabling faster and more efficient processing for specific workloads.
**Use Cases:** ML training/inference, video rendering, simulations.

## üéØ EC2 Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. **What is EC2?**
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a core AWS service that lets you rent virtual servers (instances) in the cloud to run applications. It's scalable, flexible, and supports a wide variety of workloads.

---

### 2. **What are EC2 instance types?**
Instance types are combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and network resources tailored to different use cases like compute-optimized, memory-optimized, etc.

---

### 3. **What is an AMI?**
An AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is a template with software configuration (OS, apps, data) used to launch EC2 instances.

---

### 4. **What is the difference between EBS and Instance Store?**
- **EBS:** Persistent block storage, survives instance stop/start.
- **Instance Store:** Temporary, data lost when instance is stopped or terminated.

---

### 5. **What is a Security Group?**
A Security Group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances. It's stateful and allows return traffic by default.

---

### 6. **What are Key Pairs?**
Used for SSH authentication. Public key is stored in AWS, private key is held by the user.

---

### 7. **What are EC2 pricing models?**
- On-Demand
- Reserved Instances
- Spot Instances
- Dedicated Hosts
- Savings Plans

---

### 8. **How to monitor EC2 instances?**
Using Amazon CloudWatch for:
- CPU utilization
- Disk I/O
- Network traffic
- Status checks
Also includes logs and alarms.

---

### 9. **What is Auto Scaling?**
Auto Scaling adjusts the number of instances based on demand. Helps with high availability and cost control.

---

### 10. **What‚Äôs the difference between Stop and Terminate?**
- **Stop:** Instance shut down, can restart later.

- Click the **"Launch Instance"** button.

---

### 3. **Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**
- Select an AMI (e.g., Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu, Windows Server).
- You can also use your custom AMI or one from AWS Marketplace.

---

### 4. **Choose Instance Type**
- Pick an instance type based on your workload (e.g., `t2.micro`, `m5.large`).
- AWS Free Tier eligible: `t2.micro` or `t3.micro`.

---

### 5. **Configure Instance Settings**
- Number of instances
- Network: Choose a **VPC** and **subnet**
- IAM role (optional but recommended)
- Enable monitoring (CloudWatch)
- Add **User Data** (optional) ‚Äî run a script at launch.

---

### 6. **Add Storage**
- Add one or more **EBS volumes**
- Choose size, type (e.g., gp2, gp3), and whether to delete on termination
- Optionally encrypt the volume

---

### 7. **Configure Security Group**
- Set inbound rules: e.g., allow **SSH (port 22)** for Linux or **RDP (port 3389)** for Windows
- Restrict access using IPs (e.g., `My IP` or CIDR range)
- Set outbound rules (usually allow all)

---

### 8. **Choose Key Pair**
- Select an existing **Key Pair**, or create a new one
- Download and save the `.pem` file securely ‚Äî **you cannot download it again**
- You‚Äôll need it to SSH into the instance

---

### 9. **Review and Launch**
- Review all settings: AMI, instance type, security group, key pair, etc.
- Click **"Launch"**
- Your instance will be in `pending` state, then transition to `running`

---

### 10. **Connect to Your EC2 Instance**

#### For Linux:
```bash
ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@your-public-ip
