☁️ # What is Cloud?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing resources—like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet, with pay-as-you-go pricing.

Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers or servers, you can rent computing power and storage from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).
🧠 Simple Analogy

    Before Cloud: You had to buy and manage physical hardware.

    With Cloud: You rent computing resources over the internet—just like how you stream movies instead of owning DVDs.
