# ☁️ What is Cloud?

**Cloud computing** is the **on-demand delivery of computing resources**—like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—**over the internet**, with **pay-as-you-go pricing**.

Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers or servers, you can rent computing power and storage from a cloud provider like **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

## 🧠 Simple Analogy

- **Before Cloud**: You had to buy and manage physical hardware.
- **With Cloud**: You rent computing resources over the internet—just like how you stream movies instead of owning DVDs.
